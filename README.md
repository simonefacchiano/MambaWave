# MambaWave: Neural Raw Audio Upsampling with Mamba and Diffusion Models

Welcome to the **MambaWave** repository. 
MambaWave is a project for the DLAI course at Sapienza University of Rome. It is the first work combining Diffusion Models with Mamba 🐍 for Neural Audio Upsampling task. The project will be extended in the future, stay tuned 👀.


### Architecture of the model

The architecture of MambaWave draws ispiration from DiffWave. It implements one Mamba layer to exploit the capability of SSMs to operate on long sequences.
